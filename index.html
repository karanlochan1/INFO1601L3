      <h1>Sample Poem</h1>
      <h2>Come to Labs</h2>
      <p><span class="bold-word">Why</span> won't students come to labs? This is something I always ponder.  
      After unprepared students write exams, They watch their marks in wonder.</p>

      <p><span class="bold-word">Why</span> won't students come to labs? What is more important than class?  
      How can you be a student if you don't even try to pass?</p>

      <p><span class="bold-word">Why</span> won't students come to labs? It happens all the time.  
      If you came to labs, you'd know what to do. But you would rather duck and go lime.</p>

      <p><span class="bold-word">Why</span> won't students come to labs? I see them all now stressing.  
      If you only learned this basic programming, You would surely now be zessing.</p>
